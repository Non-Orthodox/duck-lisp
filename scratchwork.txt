Goal: Small scripting language that can be embedded anywhere, though not necessarily with the compiler attached.
Features:
	Lisp syntax
	No dependency on any library.
	C/C++
Drawbacks:
	Lisp syntax
	Redundant code due to lack of libraries.

Types
	constant
	name
	function
Composite Types
	enum
	array
	struct
	union

Objects
	int
	bool
	enum
	array
	string
	struct
	union
	function

There will be a parent table called _. This table is the parent of all global variables.
There is no type difference between a string and an identifier. A string constant can contain any character. An identifier must start with a letter or identifier_symbol and the rest of the characters must be letters, identifier_symbols or numbers.
If an identifier is passed to a expression or subexpression, the value will be used in the operation if possible. If the identifier cannot be found in the variable list, then the identifier will be converted into a string literal.
Every expression is a table. When executing a table, the first value must be a function.
("a" "b" "c") is {"a", "b", "c"}.

((a ('a' 'b' 'c')) 'b' 'c')

a/b/c
a/b:

When calling a function, there are two tables. The first is the table that passed to the function. The second is the table that defines how the function is called.

[function f [a b c] [
	[return [+ a b c]]
]]
[f 1 2 3]

The calling list is f [1 2 3]
The definition list is f [a b c]
This is the same call expressed in a different way: [f f.b:2 f.c:3 f.a:1], or [f .b:2 .c:3 .a:1] (shorthand) This can be represented in the AST, but it will not necessarily execute sucessfully if the members are defined outside the function call.

evaluateSubexpression -> Returns a bool, an int, a float, a string, or an identifier.

Data tree
	Access by name is fast.
	Hashes of a given string must always return the same value no matter the scope.
	An object's parent object is its namespace.
	An object may have children.

Can have two methods of execution
	Tree walk
	Virtual machine

Function types
	Bytecode generation
		Appends or inserts bytecode into the block.
	C callback
		Inserts C function call into block in bytecode wrapper.
		This class of functions is called by a bytecode generation function.
	Heterogeneous
		Calls bytecode and callback functions.

It turns out that this was not a bug in the allocator. Hurrah!
                (dl_memoryBlock_t) { /* 90 */
                        .block = 4A690AF, /* offset = 111 */

                        .nextBlock = 94,
                },

                (dl_memoryBlock_t) { /* 44 */

                        .unlinked = false,
                        .previousBlock = 42,

I'm going to split the compiler and VM to a certain extent. DuckLisp will always have the VM, but it won't always have the compiler. This will allow me to use as little memory as possible on small devices. For example, I doubt MicroComp will be able to compile DuckLisp for a while, even after a C compiler is ported to it.

Constant propigation
	All the function has to do is be marked as pure. If it is pure and all arguments are constants, then the function may be pre-calculated in that instance.
Tail call
	Is a recursive call the last function called? Replace the arguments and jump to the beginning.


Bookmark:
	Figure out how bytecode chunks are structured in relation to each other before they are merged.
		Function definitions can all be placed at the end of the program.
		Function calls will only be generated after the function has been defined.
	Make `compile` generate function call bytecode and call generators.
	I have encountered a need for temporary variables. The question is, how do I allocate and free them? Once I've solved that, is there an easy way to do it more efficiently?
	The problem with recursion is lack of context. With a stack, I can just pop the last value to see the context. With a function call, I can't see anything above the current function.
