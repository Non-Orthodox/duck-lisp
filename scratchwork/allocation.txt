We start with two blocks. The first block is the block list; the second block is unallocated memory.
We can split blocks; we can merge blocks.

Can I call realloc on the block list?

malloc
	splitBlock // Maybe
		realloc(bl, +1)
			free(bl)
				mergeBlocks // Maybe
			malloc(nbl, +1)
				// Recursion?
			copy(nbl, bl)
			bl = nbl
