We start with two blocks. The first block is the block list; the second block is unallocated memory.
We can split blocks; we can merge blocks.

Can I call realloc on the block list?

malloc
	splitBlock // Maybe
		realloc(bl, +1)
			free(bl)
				mergeBlocks // Maybe
			malloc(nbl, +1)
				// Recursion?
			copy(nbl, bl)
			bl = nbl



malloc
	reserveTableEntry
	findBlock
	splitBlock
	block.allocated = true

free
	pointerToBlock
	block.allocated = false
	mergeBlocks

realloc
	pointerToBlock
	block.allocated = false
	mergeBlockAfter
	bf = blockFits
	if !bf
		mergeBlockBefore
	block.allocated = true
	reserveTableEntry
	block.allocated = false
	if !bf
		findBlock
	splitBlock
	if !bf
		copy
	block.allocated = true
